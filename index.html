Brimming just below the surface of the Earth is a virtually inexhaustible supply of clean energy, produced by the decay of radioactive elements in the crust. Why is such a glaringly obvious source of energy still untapped? Why is geothermal energy so underground it’s been called "<a href=" https://www.npr.org/2018/02/04/582132168/the-forgotten-renewable-geothermal-energy-production-heats-up">the forgotten renewable</a>"?</p>


        <p>Near the surface, the temperature of the crust increases about 25°C per kilometer. Yet there’s a lot of geographic variation: some places, the Earth heats up much faster. </p>

                    <p>Conventional geothermal development requires three phenomena to occur in one place: heat, permeability, and water. In order to produce electricity, we drill wells, then draw liquid through the rocks to produce steam and turn turbines. Since the geographic coincidence of these three requirements is very limited, geothermal development in the U.S. has been limited to several hotspots in the west.</p>

                    <p>Even with these limitations, geothermal has been making gains. The Geysers area north of San Francisco is the largest geothermal producer in the world, and total production was projected to double in 2014.</p>

                    <p>The advent of a new approach called enhanced geothermal systems(EGS) means that many more areas may become viable in the near future. EGS overcomes the limitations of traditional geothermal by injecting liquid via wells, increasing the permeability. In principle this is similar to the way fracking works. There are some concerns about induced seismicity.</p>

        <p><span class="firstCharacter">S</span>till, for right now geothermal lags behind wind and solar. There are several valid reasons for this. One is the high fixed capital required to build geothermal plants.</p>

       <!--  <h4 class="chartTitle">Total Installed Cost</h4> -->

        <p class="key installed"></p>

        <div class="lineChart installed"></div>

        <p>But over the lifetime of the project, geothermal is highly competititve.</p>

        <!-- <h4 class="chartTitle">LCOE</h4> -->

        <p class="key lcoe"></p>

        <div class="lineChart lcoe"></div>

        <p>Site identification and development are significant challenges for geothermal. Yet EGS means that the future is bright. And geothermal is superior to solar and wind in a couple ways. One, that the energy supply is constant, 24/7/365. Second is that geothermal is less expensive in terms of the land necessary- you don’t need sprawling amounts of land and the development is mostly underground.</p>

        <div class="chart"></div>

        <p>Right now, geothermal is only a tiny fraction of total energy production in the United States. But researchers estimate EGS could provide 100GW of viable energy production, increasing the total by a factor of 40.</p>
